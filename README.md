### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marcel and I'm 20 years old. Currently I'm studying Computer Science.<br>
My main focus in programming are computer games, how the math behind all our beloved games work and how to implement them myself. Since I don't hate myself, I use a library called [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) which is very useful and still pretty fast.



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
      - [Terraria Clone using Raylib](https://github.com/arellak/TerrariaClone)
- âœ¨ Main/Strong languages: Java, C++
- ðŸ“œ Other languages I'm familiar with: JavaScript, NodeJS, PHP
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning C++, Norwegian and a bit of Japanese
- ðŸ’¬ Other projects I really loved working on:
  - [The idea of creating a "World of Warcraft for Minecraft"](https://github.com/NimbleServer/NimbleServerPlugins)
  - [Create Graphs by including a CSV file using ImGui](https://github.com/arellak/CSVGraph)
  - [A "BankManagementSystem" aka I was bored and wanted to learn some C](https://github.com/arellak/BankManagementSystem)
  - [Creating basic GUI elements using Raylib and C++](https://github.com/arellak/NimbleGUI)
  - [My own implementation of the famous game Flappy Bird - using raylib](https://github.com/arellak/RaylibFlappyBird)
